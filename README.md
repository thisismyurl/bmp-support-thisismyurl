**BMP Support by thisismyurl** is a specialized performance utility designed for users who need to manage BitMap images without compromising their site�s speed or user experience.

Standard WordPress configurations often restrict BMP uploads because of their massive, uncompressed file sizes. This plugin removes that limitation, allowing you to upload `.bmp` files directly to your Media Library while providing a smart engine to convert them into modern, web-ready formats instantly.

### Why Optimization Matters
Large, uncompressed images are the leading cause of slow page speeds. By transforming heavy BMP files into **WebP** or **AVIF** upon upload, you maintain visual clarity while significantly reducing your site's storage and bandwidth footprint.

### Key Benefits & Features:
* **Enable BMP Uploads:** Safely unlock support for `.bmp` files within your WordPress Media Library.
* **Automated Image Conversion:** Instantly convert legacy BMP data into ultra-lightweight WebP or AVIF formats.
* **Smart Ecosystem Integration:** The plugin automatically recognizes our **WebP Support** and **AVIF Support** plugins to expand your optimization options.
* **Precision Quality Control:** Use integrated sliders in the Tools menu to find the perfect balance between quality and compression.
* **Lightweight Performance:** Built on our shared TIMU Core library to ensure a stable, bloat-free experience.

## ⚙️ Installation
1. Upload the `bmp-support-thisismyurl` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Navigate to **Tools > BMP Support** to configure your preferred handling and quality settings.
